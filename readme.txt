= Lithium Ion Charger =

This project contains that code and circuit diagrams for a simple single-cell Li-ion charger. It charges at a roughly constant current until the cells approach 4.2 volts. 

This charge method does not provide optimum cell capacity, but does provide a simple way to charge cells which should provide a long working life. 

A flashing LED indicator is also provided which flashes to indicate that charging is taking place. Faster flashing indicates less remaining charge time. A steady on indicates that charging is complete.
